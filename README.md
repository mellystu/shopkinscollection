# shopkinscollection
My daughter is learning to program by writing an application 
to keep track of her Shopkin collection. This web version uses 
the following:

* Ruby 2.3.1, Rails 4.2.7


This application will keep track of the following Shopkin information

* Name
* Season
* Quantity
* Category
* Locations
* Rarity
* Main Color
* Trading Status
* Id (which will be the Id of the shopkin in the collector guide)


The application will have the following user types

* Browser - Can view the site
* Admin - Can add/edit data
* Trader - Can make requests to do a trade for Shopkins

Authentication and roles will need to be added for Admin and Trader. Browser is the default.

The application will be able to do the following

* All can search for shopkins by name
* All can browse for shopkins by Season, Main Color, Category

Trader Users can also do the following
* Browse for shopkins by Tradability


Shopkin Information View will show for all Users
* Name
* Season
* Quantity
* Main Color
* Rarity
* Category

Shopking Information for Traders will also show
* Tradability


Admin users can
* CRUD all Shopkin Information
* Create Trader Accounts

Traders can
* Perform trade requests. 


The stories for performing actions for this application will be written out later. Tests will be used to make 
sure that requirements are being met.
